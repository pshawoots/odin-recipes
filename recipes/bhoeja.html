    <h2>Buttered Tea aka Cha Bhoeja</h2>
    <p>
        Buttered Tea, as its name suggests, is made by mixing butter (usually salted), milk, and usually black tea. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The tea is savoury, salty and can be a strange experience for regular tea drinkers but is sure to warm up any who 
        drink it during a cold winter's morning.
