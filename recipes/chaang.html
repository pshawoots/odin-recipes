    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups Jasmine Rice</li>
        <li>5 cups of Water</li>
        <li>1 Table spoon of dry yeast</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prep</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash your hands.</li>
        <li>Wash and dry a container large enough to put the rice and water in for fermentation.</li>
        <li>Prep a clean surface to lay down your cooked rice.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook your rice as you normally would. We use a rice cooker, with 5 cups of jasmine rice, and water filled to the 5 cup line.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, stir around the rice in the rice cooker or pot your cooked it in. You want to sort of loosen and fluff the rice up – you don’t want it packy or clumpy at all.</li>
        <li>Spread the rice onto your very clean working surface to cool it. Work through the rice when it is cool enough to touch, loosening up any clumpy bits.</li>
        <li>Allow the rice to cool until its warm to the touch.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If the rice is too hot when you add the yeast, you will get sour chang.</li>
            <li>If the rice is too cold, it will take longer to ferment, which is okay, if you have time. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Sprinkle the dried yeast over the rice and mix it in very well.</li>
        <li>Pour the rice mixture in your prepared container.</li>
        <li>Cover it with a lid.</li>
        <li>Swaddle the container like a baby in a couple of warm blankets.</li>
        <li>Leave it for 4-5 days and do not open it in the mean time. </li>
        <li>After 7 days open it and you'll notice a fermented and a bit alcoholic smell. </li>
        <li>Add 3 cups of water to the container and leave in a refrigerator.</li>
        <li>After 24 hours it is ready! You can keep it in there for longer if you want.</li>
    </ol>
